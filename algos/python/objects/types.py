'''
    Python is a DYNAMIC & STRONG type system.

    Dynamically typed languages, are so because they are not exectuded until the program that they are defining is run.
    In contrast, languages like Java, C, C++ all run their programs BEFORE they are actually executed.  Hence their Strict type system.

    Python also allows for type's to be IMPLICITLY altered when combining certain types.
